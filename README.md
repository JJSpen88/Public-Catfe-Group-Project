What I'll Have to Learn

Utilizing my coding skills, I look forward to having a more real-life experience and working as part of a team. I would like to be able to bring my design abilities to the table so that the end result is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. I'm hoping to learn more about UX design through this project. 
- Nyssa

How to bridge the gap between JavaScript and Java along with the technologies used for both. We would also be learning how to utilize multiple APIs within our site.
Time management to dedicate to the project and using tools such as Trello as a group to manage our tasks 
- Niquelle

Designing and building a complete web app from a wireframe to a MVP that utilizes multiple API calls to libraries as well as a database, while gaining experience in a team environment. Using team management tools like trello, miro, and github to collaborate with team members.
