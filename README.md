Welcome to CatFe README

Overview
Web app designed to centralize information for cat cafes in the user’s area. This app will aggregate these cafes in a uniform, yet visually appealing and more digestible form for prospective customers.

What I'll Have to Learn

Utilizing my coding skills, I look forward to having a more real-life experience and working as part of a team. I would like to be able to bring my design abilities to the table so that the end result is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. I'm hoping to learn more about UX design through this project. -Nyssa

How to bridge the gap between JavaScript and Java along with the technologies used for both. We would also be learning how to utilize multiple APIs within our site.
Time management to dedicate to the project and using tools such as Trello as a group to manage our tasks - Niquelle
